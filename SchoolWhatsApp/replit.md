# School SMS Sender - Student Management Platform

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application built as a school management platform with SMS messaging integration using Fast2SMS. The system allows schools to manage student information, send targeted SMS messages to students or specific grade levels, and track messaging statistics.

## System Architecture

The application follows a monorepo structure with a clear separation between frontend, backend, and shared components:

- **Frontend**: React-based SPA using Vite as the build tool
- **Backend**: Express.js REST API server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Shared**: Common schemas and types shared between frontend and backend
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn/ui components with Radix UI primitives and Tailwind CSS

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming
- **Animations**: GSAP for enhanced user interactions
- **Build Tool**: Vite with React plugin

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **API Design**: RESTful API with consistent error handling
- **Data Validation**: Zod schemas for request/response validation
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL session store

### Database Schema
The application uses three main tables:
- **Students**: Core student information (name, grade, phone, student ID, notes)
- **Messages**: Message tracking (content, target type/grade, recipient count, status)
- **Users**: Basic user authentication (kept from original template)

### UI Component System
- **Design System**: New York style from Shadcn/ui
- **Component Library**: Comprehensive set of reusable components
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Toast Notifications**: Custom toast system for user feedback
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints

## Data Flow

1. **Student Management**: CRUD operations for student records with real-time updates
2. **Message Composition**: Create messages targeting all students or specific grade levels
3. **WhatsApp Integration**: Format and validate phone numbers for WhatsApp API compatibility
4. **Statistics Tracking**: Real-time dashboard showing student counts, message statistics, and success rates
5. **Data Export**: Excel and PDF export functionality for student data

## External Dependencies

### Core Framework Dependencies
- React ecosystem (React, ReactDOM, React Hook Form)

- Express.js for backend API
- Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL driver

### UI and Styling
- Radix UI primitives for accessible components
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Lucide React for icons
- GSAP for animations

### Database and Storage
- Neon Database for serverless PostgreSQL
- PostgreSQL session store for session management
- Drizzle Kit for database migrations

### Utilities and Tools
- Zod for schema validation
- Axios for HTTP requests
- Date-fns for date manipulation
- XLSX and jsPDF for data export

## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured for deployment on Replit with the following setup:

### Development Mode
- Frontend: Vite dev server with HMR
- Backend: Express server with TypeScript execution via tsx
- Database: Connects to Neon Database via DATABASE_URL environment variable

### Production Build
- Frontend: Vite builds static assets to `dist/public`
- Backend: esbuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- Deployment: Single Node.js process serving both API and static files

### Environment Configuration
- Database connection via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Development/production mode detection via `NODE_ENV`
- Replit-specific optimizations and error handling
